ðŸš€ Day 2: Growing with NumPy, Pandas & Matplotlib
One of my main goals this year is to continuously invest in myself and build strong technical skills in Data Science & AI. Today was another step forward in that journey.

Hereâ€™s what I focused on ðŸ‘‡

ðŸŽ¥ NumPy Tutorial â€“ https://lnkd.in/dRsisXhq
 I learned how NumPy makes numerical computations fast and efficient. From handling arrays to applying mathematical operations in just a few lines of code, NumPy truly forms the backbone of scientific computing in Python.

ðŸŽ¥ Pandas Tutorial â€“https://lnkd.in/djekXKkE
 Pandas taught me how to structure, clean, and transform messy data into meaningful insights. Understanding Series and DataFrames gave me the ability to work with real-world datasets in a structured way.

ðŸ“‚ Matplotlib Repo â€“https://lnkd.in/dVRsFX7v
 Visualization is where raw data transforms into stories. With Matplotlib, I explored plotting trends, charts, and visual representations that help uncover hidden patterns.

ðŸ“Œ Hands-on Task:
 I worked on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Cleaned and explored the dataset with Pandas.
Applied NumPy for calculations and transformations.
Used Matplotlib to visualize survival trends across age, gender, and passenger classes.
The biggest takeaway? ðŸ‘‰ Every dataset tells a story. Today, I took my first real steps in learning how to read and communicate that story through Python.
This journey is just starting, but with every tutorial, repo, and dataset, I feel closer to building strong foundations in AI & Data Science.
