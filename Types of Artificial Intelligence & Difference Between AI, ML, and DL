Types of Artificial Intelligence & Difference Between AI, ML, and DL

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming how we live, work, and interact with technology. From voice assistants like Siri to advanced self-driving cars, AI is shaping the future. To better understand AI, it’s important to know its types and how it differs from Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

Types of AI

AI can be categorized into three main types based on capability and functionality:

1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) — Weak AI

This is the most common form of AI today. ANI is designed to perform a specific task.

Examples: Google Search, Face Recognition, Chatbots, Spam Filters

ANI cannot think beyond its programmed purpose.

2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) — Strong AI

AGI refers to a machine that can think, understand, and make decisions like a human.

It can learn new skills and solve problems independently.

Currently, AGI does not exist—it is still a research goal.

3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

ASI goes beyond human intelligence—able to outperform us in creativity, reasoning, and problem-solving.

It is a theoretical concept and not yet achieved.

ASI could lead to revolutionary changes but also raises ethical concerns.

Difference Between AI, ML, and DL
Feature	AI (Artificial Intelligence)	ML (Machine Learning)	DL (Deep Learning)
Definition	A broad field of creating intelligent machines	A subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data	A subset of ML using neural networks to learn deeply from data
Goal	Mimic human intelligence	Learn and improve automatically from experience	Learn complex patterns using layered neural networks
Data Requirement	Can work with small or large data	Needs structured data	Requires large data and high computing power
Examples	ChatGPT, Robotics, Smart Assistants	Recommendation Systems, Spam Detection	Face Recognition, Self-Driving Cars, Voice Assistants (Alexa, Siri)
In Simple Words

AI is the overall concept of making machines smart.

Machine Learning is a method inside AI where machines learn from data.

Deep Learning is an advanced form of ML using neural networks to learn complex patterns.

Conclusion

AI, ML, and DL are interconnected but not the same. AI is the big umbrella of intelligent systems. ML gives machines the ability to learn, and DL takes this learning to a more human-like, deeper level. Understanding these differences helps us appreciate how today’s smart technologies are built and how they are shaping our world.
